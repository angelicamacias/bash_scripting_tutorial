### Example 

For let this more clear we have the next example.

In the next image we can see the code for a calculater. In the seccion *A)* stands out the recpating lines 4 times (*B*), so remember the prupose of using functions is reduce the code lengt, for that we are implementig a function. We are declaring in the seccion *C)*  our function with the name *mycode* following the syntax, it's important to mention that the function have to be before the calling it, the next step is call the function in the places where we are using the function conten, it's means we need to call the function in the place where the commands that are inside the *mycode* function were.
